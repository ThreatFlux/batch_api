This activity is often logged following a PagePrefetched event for a page. NOTE: Because ClientViewSignaled events are signaled by the client, rather than the server, it's possible the event may not be logged by the server and therefore may not appear in the audit log. It's also possible that information in the audit record may not be trustworthy. However, because the user's identity is validated by the token used to create the signal, the user's identity listed in the corresponding audit record is accurate. The system waits five minutes before it logs the same event when the same user's client signals that the page has been viewed again by the user."

When the page content is rendered by the client (as per the user's request) a ClientViewSignaled event should be generated.
